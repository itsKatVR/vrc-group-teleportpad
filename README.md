## Introduction

Group Teleport Pad is designed for UdonSharp.

## Installation
A project with the latest VRChat SDK3 Release- can be found below:
[UDON](https://vrchat.com/home/download) (Udon Worlds Latest Release)

[Udon Sharp](https://github.com/vrchat-community/UdonSharp/releases/tag/v0.20.3)

1. Install VRChat SDK3, UdonSharp, and latest release of [TELEPORT PAD](https://github.com/itsKatVR/vrc-group-teleportpad/releases/latest)!
2. Inside of the "PadTP" Folder you will find the Prefab.
3. Drag Teleport Pad (Prefab) into Scene.

## How it works
By standing on the Teleport Pad you, and any user are added to a list.
When the Teleport Button is pressed, it checks against this list to determine if you should be teleported.

By stepping off, at any time you ensure that you will not be teleported.
You can also step on at any time to ensure you are teleported.


```
$ ./That one time at band camp.
